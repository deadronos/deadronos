# 🚀 Hey, I'm deadronos!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub. I'm a hobby developer who loves automation-heavy games, idle/incremental games, and pulsing psytrance soundtracks. I tinker a lot, ship often, and learn along the way.

## Experimental Showcase of my Repositories
[**Explore the Project Hub**](https://deadronosrepohub.vercel.app/) — A curated collection of web experiments, games, and prototypes.

## 🌌 Featured projects
- **[SpaceAutoBattler](https://github.com/deadronos/SpaceAutoBattler):** A cosmic auto-battler experiment watching big fleets fight around a WebGL space environment.
- **[mining-drones-idle](https://github.com/deadronos/mining-drones-idle):** An idle/automation prototype about directing swarms of drones, tuning production chains, and squeezing every last resource.

## 🎯 What I'm focused on
- Building small, replayable strategy or idle prototypes with resource loops.
- Learning by doing: shipping iterations, refactoring, and polishing UX.
- Keeping things moddable and data-driven whenever possible.

## 🧰 Tech & tools
- TypeScript, React, React Three Fiber
- Want to learn Godot or Unity some time
- I am leaning heavy into various AI tools, GitHub Copilot, Codex and Gemini
- Mostly using VS Code, but trying out CLI and Antigravity also.

## 🎶 Vibe check
If you love Factorio-style optimization or psytrance powering late-night builds, we already have something in common. Drop by the repos above, open an issue, or just say hi — always happy to chat about automation and game loops.
