## 2024-02-14 - URL Accessibility in Documentation
**Learning:** Profile READMEs often use raw URLs as "self-explanatory" links, which can be verbose for screen readers and lack context.
**Action:** Always wrap URLs in descriptive text (e.g., `[Project Name](url)`) to provide context and improve the "lobby" experience for all users.

**Learning:** Typos and inconsistent casing (e.g., "Typescript" vs "TypeScript") in documentation lower perceived quality and increase cognitive load for readers.
**Action:** Treat copy editing as a UX task—scan for brand casing and typos to maintain a professional "interface".
